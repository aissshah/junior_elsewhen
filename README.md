# Take Home Test

## Task
Creating a Single Page Application (SPA) with two screens. This app uses the GitHub API to display information on an organisation's public repositories on GitHub.

It consists of the homepage where users can fill in an organisation name to see a list of their public repositories and the contributors page which displays the contributors of a certain GitHub repository. 

## Overall Checklist

- [ ] More interested in how it is made, rather than how it looks
- [ ] Readable and expressive code
- [ ] Progression captured in git commits
- [ ] (Optional) Simulation of a big project - make it scalable to handle addition of features
- [ ] (Optional) Make it shareable - if you have the same link, you have the same state
- [ ] (Optional) Write tests
- [ ] (Optional) Handle couple of edge cases [no network, wrong entry]
- [ ] (Optional) Evidence of best practices

## What I would do differently next time:
- set up code formatter e.g. prettier at the start of the project and run before each commit
- add comments while writing or at the very least, before each commit
- decide on which features from the checklist to include from the start

## Getting Started
Clone or download the repository
`cd junior_elsewhen` - move into 
`npm i` - install dependencies
`npm start` - runs the app in development mode on localhost:3000
